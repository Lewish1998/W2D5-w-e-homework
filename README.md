# w2D5-w-e-homework

Create tests before diving into vs-code!
create classes directory instead of classes folder 
create testes folder
create .gitignore file and copy and paste py cache from getting started file on github

The reason for this is we do not want to keep the cache forever.
create run_tests.py file and set up to run tests

again, everything is in the get started file.

THIS IS A PDA HOMEWORK!!!!!
